Question: What is the elevation range for the area that is part of the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny?

Thought 1: I need to search for the Colorado orogeny, find the area that is part of the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny, and then find the elevation range for that area.
Action 1: Search[Colorado orogeny]
Observation 1: The Colorado orogeny was an episode of mountain building (orogeny) in Colorado and the surrounding area.

Thought 2: There is no mention of the eastern sector. So I need to find the eastern sector.
Action 2: Search[eastern sector]
Observation 2: (Result 1 / 1) The eastern sector extends into the Plateau and is called the Central Plains orogeny.

Thought 3: The eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into the Plateau. So I need to find the Plateau and find its elevation range.
